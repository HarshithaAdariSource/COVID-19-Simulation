# COVID-19 Simulation Project

## Project Title

COVID-19 Spread Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is a simple simulation of how COVID-19 spreads in a small population. The main idea is to show how the virus transmits from person to person based on contact and how factors like recovery and isolation affect the spread. This project was created for learning and academic purposes to understand the basic concepts of disease modelling and simulation.

The simulation visually demonstrates the behavior of individuals such as healthy, infected, and recovered people over time.

## Objectives

* To simulate the spread of COVID-19 in a controlled environment
* To understand how fast a virus can spread
* To observe the effect of recovery and isolation
* To visualize infection patterns

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Matplotlib 
* Streamlit


---

## How the Simulation Works

* Each circle represents a person
* Green = Healthy
* Red = Infected
* Blue = Recovered
* When an infected person comes close to a healthy person, the healthy one may get infected
* After a certain time, infected people recover and become immune

## Conclusion

This COVID-19 simulation helps in understanding how quickly a virus can spread and why preventive measures are important. It is a basic model but gives a clear idea of real-world pandemic behavior.
